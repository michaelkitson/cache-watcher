cache-watcher
=============

A simple bash script to save mp4 files that show up in my browser cache (songs from songza.com)

Nothing too serious, just something I hacked together at three in the morning when I realized that songza doesn't set the no-cache header.
This could easily change in the future, so be warned, this will probably break. If I notice, I'll put up a warning or try to fix it.
